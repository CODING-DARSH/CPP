Friend function
---------------------------------------------------------------
Friend function is basically used for accessing elements of private and protected elements or data
it is declared inside class and then we write function outside class

virtual function
---------------------------------------------------------------
virtual function is basically a type of function which is created in parent class and is created with virtual name in  in parent class and then in child classes that function is created again without virtual keyword virtual means basicallyit tells that this function can be over write and also only access that particular function which is called
Person *p;  -->parent
studnet s;  -->child
p=&s;   -->here addrees of s is given to p 
p->showRole();  and as we now hve addrees of s when we call with -> we will hve studnet function called

pure virtual function
---------------------------------------------------------------
it is basically part of abstraction and is declared inside parent class without anu details
Declared with = 0 at the end.
inside child class we will write function without virtual word 
And we cannot create object of this class in main we will directly create object of child class and wwe will call that function
virtual void showRole() = 0;
void showRole()
